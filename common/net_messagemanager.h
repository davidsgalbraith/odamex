// DESCRIPTION:
// 
// The MessageManager classes manage the delivery and receipt of messages to
// and from the remote host. Each MessageManger implementation provides
// certain guarantees about the delivery of a message. This guarantee becomes
// important in instances where the packet transmitting messages is lost and
// some data may need to be resent. The guarantees are as follows:
//
// TiccmdManager: TiccmdMessages (player controller input) are sent in-order
// and each TiccmdMessage is repeated in every outgoing packet until that
// particular message has been acknowledged as being received. This is cruical
// to ensure that TiccmdMessages is received as soon as possible, even
// with packet loss.
//
// ReplicationManager: Handles sending and receiving state updates for game
// entities, such as actors and moving sectors. The ReplicationManager is
// responsible for tracking which fields of an entity's state changed and the
// time the change occured. This is so that the ReplicationManager can send
// clients only the state fields that have changed since the last acknowledged
// replication update for that entity. Lost ReplicationMessages are not resent
// because state data is likely to be stale by the time it is resent. However,
// a new ReplicationMessage is created with fresh state data that includes the
// fields contained in the lost message and is sent at the scheduled interval.
//
// UrgentEventManager: UrgentEventMessages are messages that need to be
// delivered in-order and as fast as possible, even with packet loss. Similar
// to the TiccmdManager, the UrgentEventManager repeats all of its outgoing
// messages into every packet until those messages have been acknowledged
// being received. This guarantees that UrgentEventMessages will be received
// before messages of other types, which is cruicial in cases where you want
// map change messages to arrive before any other messages to avoid harmful
// side-effects of applying messages before loading the correct map.
//
// OrderedEventManager: Delivers event messages that are guaranteed to be
// received and processed in-order. Each event message is assigned a sequential
// ID number and messages are processed according to the ordering of their ID.
// A remote host can process ordered event messages until it finds a gap in the
// sequential ID numbers. At that point, it must wait until the missing event
// messages are resent and moved to the front of the processing queue.
//
// EventManager: Sends unguaranteed event messages to the remote host. A
// message is only sent once, even if the packet transmitting it is lost.
// The message is freed immediately after being written into a packet.
//
// The order in which MessageManagers are allowed to write into a packet is
// as follows:
//     UrgentEventManager
//     TiccmdManager
//     OrderedEventManager
//     EventManager
//     ReplicationManager

// MessageManager abstract base class interface
//
// MessageManagers handle the serialization of certain families of Message
// objects and implicitly define rules for the reliability of those Message
// objects. A MessageManager keeps track of which messages went into each
// packet and uses this information to resend any data it needs to when it
// receives notification that a packet was lost.
//
// The low-level networking subsystem is responsible for notifying the
// MessageManager of successful delivery or failure of a packet and
// MessageManager is responsible for deciding to resend any lost data according
// to its policy.
//

// UrgentMessageManager abstract base class interface
//
// The UrgentMessageManager uses a "guaranteed fastest" algorithm for sending
// ordered Messages. This means that every time the UrgentMessageManager is
// asked to write into a packet, it will write every Message that the recipient
// has not yet acknowledged receiving. This brute-force method handles
// resending of lost Messages implicitly by assuming that every message is lost
// until its receipt has been acknowledged. As messages will be resent several
// times before acknowledgement is received, this method trades heavier
// bandwidth usage in exchange for more immediate handling of lost messages.

// replicating the data fields of an entity which have changed since the last
// acknowledged replication of that entity. If a replication message for an
// entity is lost, it will not be resent. Instead, the next replication
// message for the entity will include the most recent state of the fields
// that were in the lost message as well as any fields that have changed since.
